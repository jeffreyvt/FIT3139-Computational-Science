A = [[1, 4],
    [1, 1]]

a) The characteristic polynomial is: lambda^2 - 2*lambda - 3 = 0

b) Solving the equation, we get two eigenvalues: lambda1 = 3, lambda2 = -1

c) The eigenvector with the corresponding eigenvalue of 3 is: [[2], [1]]
   The eigenvector with the corresponding eigenvalue of -1 is: [[-2], [1]]
